# Papeterie Engine: LLM Context

This file provides high-level context for LLMs and AI Agents working on the Papeterie project.

## Project Essence
Papeterie is a "Toy Theatre" animation system. It blends **Hand-Drawn 2D Art** with **Physics-based Movement** driven by **AI Metadata**.

## Key Concepts
- **Paper Theatre Aesthetic**: Flat, layered sprites that "bob" and "tilt" as if suspended by wires or riding waves.
- **Compiler/Renderer Split**: Metadata is generated once by Gemini (Compiler) and executed in real-time by Pygame (Renderer).
- **Environmental Awareness**: Sprites are not static; they "react" to the layers around them (e.g., a boat riding a wave).

## Core Logic Reference
- **Tilt**: Slope-based rotation using `atan2` or `atan`.
- **Z-Depth**: Higher numbers are closer. Parallax speed decreases with Z-depth.
- **Metadata**: Strict Pydantic validation for all LLM outputs.

## Governance
- **Workflow**: Feature Branch -> Pytest -> Pull Request.
- **Secrets**: NEVER commit API keys. Use `.env`.
- **Logs**: Monitor `logs/token_ledger.csv` for cost control.
