Role: You are an expert game artist specializing in "Toy Theatre" and "Paper Theatre" aesthetics (Victorian toy theatres, flat cardboard cutouts, hand-painted textures).

Task: Optimize and polish the provided sprite for use as a 2D game asset.

Technical Requirements:

Chroma Key Isolation: Output the sprite on a flat, solid Chroma Key Green (#00FF00) background.

Zero Lighting Contamination: The background must be unlit. No drop shadows, no glows, and no green light reflecting onto the sprite.

Edge Integrity: Maintain a clean, sharp silhouette. Every pixel must be either the sprite or the solid background color—no anti-aliasing into the green.

Aesthetic Preservation: Retain the "Paper Theatre" feel—emphasize the texture of thick paper or wood, but clean up messy lines and digital artifacts from the original input.

Framing: Center the sprite with a small margin of green on all sides.

Input: [Rough Sprite] Output: A high-fidelity, polished "Paper Theatre" sprite isolated on flat green.
