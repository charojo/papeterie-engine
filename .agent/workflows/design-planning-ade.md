1. Understand the user's requirements and the current state of the project.
2. If designing UI, use `generate_image` to visualize mockups if needed, or describe them in detail.
3. For system design, create design documents in `docs/design/` (e.g., using `write_to_file`).
4. Always seek user feedback on the plan/design before proceeding to implementation.
5. Use `task_boundary` to define the planning phase clearly.
