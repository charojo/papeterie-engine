1. Start by analyzing the current architecture and codebase structure.
2. Create or update a design document in `docs/design/` outlining the proposed architectural changes.
3. Review the proposed changes with the user to ensure alignment with project goals.
4. Break down the implementation into smaller, manageable steps (using `task.md` or similar).
5. Proceed with implementation only after the design is approved.
6. Ensure that changes are backward compatible or that migration paths are documented.
