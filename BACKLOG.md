# Project Backlog

This file lists features, improvements, and bugs to be addressed in the Papeterie Engine. Gemini can refer to this backlog for future tasks and suggestions.

## Unprioritized / Ideas

*   **Interactive Sprite Editing Mode:** Implement an in-application edit mode where users can select individual sprites and move them vertically (up/down) using interactive controls. This mode would require a 'Save' button to persist the adjusted `y_offset` (and potentially `x_offset`) values back into the `sceneX.json` file for the active scene. This would allow for visual fine-tuning of sprite positions.
